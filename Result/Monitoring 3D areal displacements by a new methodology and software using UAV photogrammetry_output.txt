2. Research Purpose and Hypothesis
Research Topic: The research focuses on the monitoring of 3D areal displacements, particularly the potential use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) photogrammetry in monitoring movements with large mass.
Hypothesis/Problem Statement: A new methodology using UAV photogrammetry technology can be successful in monitoring and analyzing 3D areal displacements.

3. Participants and Study Area
Participant Information: The research was not conducted on a specific subject population, therefore this information is not available.
Study Area: Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Turkey

4. Methodology
Data Collection Method: Three periods of flights using UAV photogrammetry method.
Tools/Instruments Used: UAV, GNSS, Kalman Filtering Technique, Interpolation Maps
Data Analysis Method: Statistical analyses (t-test, f-test, RMSE, VAF).

5. Results
Key Findings: It was found that significant velocity values greater than 1.5 × GSD could be successfully determined with those obtained from GNSS. Cyrano maps were created to compare areal displacements between GNSS and UAV velocity values.
Statistical Results: Correlation values were found to be 0.92, 0.75, and 0.87 respectively.

6. Authors' Recommendations and Discussion
Research Success Status: According to the research, it was concluded that UAV photogrammetry has the ability to monitor 3D areal displacements.
Authors' Recommendations and Future Research: The authors recommend further exploration of UAV photogrammetry technology's potential in this field and propose a framework for future studies.

7. Scientific Contribution and Strengths/Weaknesses
Strengths: This study provides an alternative method in 3D motion monitoring and introduces a new methodology.
